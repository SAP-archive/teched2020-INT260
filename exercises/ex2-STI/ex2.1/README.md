### Run Booster
SAP Cloud Platform creates interactive guided boosters to automate trial cockpit steps, so users can save time when trying out the services.

Now, you will use the Set up account for Service Ticket Intelligence booster to automatically assign entitlements, update your subaccount, create a service instance and the associated service key for Service Ticket Intelligence.

1. On the navigation side bar, click **Boosters**.
